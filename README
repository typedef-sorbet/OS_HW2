To Build:
	If you have make installed,

	$ make

	Otherwise, you can do

	$ gcc -o pc pc.c -lpthread -lrt
To Run:
	pc necessitates 3 command line arguments; its usage is as follows:

	$ ./pc <# producer threads> <# consumer threads> <total program duration (sec)>

	So, for example, if you wanted to run the program with 15 producers and 10 consumers for 20 seconds, you would do

	$ ./pc 15 10 20

	Note: pc implicitly assumes that command line arguments are valid integers. It will detect if they are out of range (< 1), but not if they are not integers at all.
